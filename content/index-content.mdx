# Welcome to *My Reading Display*

<Logo widthPercent='30' side='right'/>

This easy calculator will help you choose the size
of display and range of print sizes for effective reading.
My Reading Display is intended to help people with low vision
and those assisting them in choosing an appropriate digital
reading display.

Low vision refers to people who cannot achieve normal vision
with the aid of glasses or contacts. It does not refer to
people who have normal vision in one eye and reduced vision
in the other eye.

After entering your vision characteristics and viewing preferences,
the calculator will suggest the minimum display width you may need
for effective reading and the corresponding print size for your
choice of font. The calculator will also allow you to enter wider
displays and show you the corresponding range of effective print
sizes.

This calculator provides customized suggestions for display
sizes and print sizes for readers with low vision. Please note
that vision status and reading goals may vary among users and these
individual differences affect the selection of reading display.
Our calculation takes into consideration a range of fonts, but
you can also choose a specific font that you prefer to use.
The suggestions presented here represent a general guideline
and may not be appropriate for some readers.

My Reading Display was developed by Ying-Zi Xiong, Nilsu Atilgan
and Gordon E. Legge with programming by Reuben Gardos Reid, at the
University Minnesota. The calculations are based in part on published work:

To understand the vision status and reading preferences of our
users, as well as to improve our calculator, we will store the
reading-related information entered by our users, including
visual acuity, critical print size, central vision status,
preferred viewing distance and preferred font. The data is
securely stored on UMN database and can only be accessed by
researchers in the MN low vision research lab. We will NOT
store any identifiable personal information such as name,
age, gender, or IP address.
